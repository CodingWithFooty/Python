Project 2: Goal and Assist Contributions

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
#2. Create a tip calculator based on these 3 variables, bill, tip and people.
#3. Make sure the final output is rounded to two decimal places.

print ("Welcome to the tip calculator")

bill = float(input("What was the total bill? Â£"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
bill_with_tip = bill / 100 * tip + bill
bill_per_person = bill_with_tip/people
bill_per_person_rounded = round(bill_per_person,2)
print(f"Your total indidivual bill works out to be {bill_per_person_rounded}")
